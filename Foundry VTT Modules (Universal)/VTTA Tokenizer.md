### Description
Iconizer watches the creation of items in your world, and tries to find a suitable icon from a pre-populated name/icon dictionary. All you need to do, is

- downloading a suitable icon library, or use the icons that are coming with Foundry
- creating a dictionary
- create items and watch the magic happen

The item database comes pre-populated with 1800+ item name set, but lives from community contributions. While the database if 
strongly tied to the item names from D&D Beyond it works best with DND5e, but can be adapted to any game system due to the ability
to define custom databases, too
