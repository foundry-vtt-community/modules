### Description
Implements group ability and skill check rolls per Player's Handbook, page 175: "*If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.*" Modules also includes patches to implement the Halfling Lucky trait, and a house rule to use the average of 2d20 for normal skill and ability check rolls. Both of these patches can be disabled in config.js. All patches rely on the included `patchClass` utility function.
