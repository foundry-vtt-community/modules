### Description

This module adds an Application to aid in building D&D5E combat encounters. Following a similar design to [Kobold Fight Club](https://kobold.club/fight/#/encounter-builder), this module calculates encounter difficulty for your chosen PCs and monsters/NPCs. Encounter prep has never been easier!

* Calculates combat difficulty based on XP thresholds (PHB) for players
* Includes difficulty multipliers for fights against many opponents
* Adjusts difficulty for parties of <3 players, or >5 players.
* Calculates total XP and XP per player.
* Drag-and-drop tokens onto or off the Application.
