### Description
This module modifies certain sheet functions on Foundry VTT Character sheets for D&D 5th Edition. Currently, it adds compound rolls (for attack rolls and damage rolls combined), as well as "dual rolls" for all attacks, ability checks, and saving throws, rolling 2 d20s side-by-side in a single chat message. On top of this are a few options to customize layout and enable/disable certain features of the module. 
It currently supports the DnD5e Character and NPC sheets, Better NPC Sheet 5e, and Sky5e sheets, though adding support for other sheets can be done.
