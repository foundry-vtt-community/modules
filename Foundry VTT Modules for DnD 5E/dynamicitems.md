### Description
Dynamic items are ones that makes changes to your stats/modifiers when they are active in your inventory. This module is really intended for player characters and NPCs that have linked tokens.

* Armor and shields now update your armor class when equipped and reverse the change when unequipped. (this happens automatically once the module is turned on and the items are equipped). Armor can have dynamic properties, e.g. ac+2 which can require attunement.
* Rings of protection can increase saves or armor class when active, again changes are reversed when unequiped or unattuned (if that is a word).
* There is a straightforward ui to make changes/create items For more complex changes (e.g. AC based on dex mod, you need to know the attribute specification, e.g. data.avilities.dex.mod)
* Dynamic effects can be applied to any item, weapons/backpacks/armor/feats, in addition to its normal properties.
