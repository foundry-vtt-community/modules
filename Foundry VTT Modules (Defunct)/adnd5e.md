### Description
This module expands upon the existing 5e system in Foundry VTT, adding alternative PC and NPC sheets, as well as changing the system of attacks and macros, and adds a compendium for all SRD monsters, set up for use with this module. The mod is effectively a massive expansion in the ability to edit sheets for the user’s purposes, and a revamp of how the 5E system works. It is backwards-compatible with the default sheet, and can be switched between the two as needed.
