### Description
Arcane Viewing adds Audio/Video conferencing support directly from within FVTT.

Through the use of Arcane magic, you are able to see and hear your follow adventurers wherever they may hide! Peer through the looking glass and see the horror that grips them and hear their screams as they are attacked by a cute bunny. Huh?

**Note**: This module has been deprecated as most of its functionality has now been integrated into Foundry's core. See https://www.patreon.com/posts/beta-0-4-2-notes-32265287
